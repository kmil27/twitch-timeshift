## üìå Setup Guide

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Prerequisites**
Ensure you have:
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A [Twitch Developer Account](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) (for API credentials)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/twitch-timeshift.git
 cd twitch-timeshift
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Twitch API Credentials**
1. Go to the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and create a new application.
2. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. Open `docker-compose.yml` and update the environment variables:
```yaml
environment:
  TWITCH_CLIENT_ID: "your_client_id"
  TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET: "your_client_secret"
  USER_TIMEZONE: "America/New_York"  # Change to your local timezone
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Docker Container**
```bash
 docker-compose up --build -d
```
- This will build and start the service in the background.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Web UI**
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000/frontend/
```

## üìú How It Works
1. **Add a Twitch streamer** in the web UI.
2. The system **automatically records** when they go live.
3. The recording is **scheduled for playback at the next local occurrence** of its start time.
4. The playback starts **automatically at the correct time**, emulating a live stream.

‚è≥ **Example:**  
A Twitch stream starts at **8:00 PM EST**. If you are in **London (GMT)**, it will be played back at **8:00 PM GMT** the next time 8 PM happens in your timezone.

## ‚ùå Stopping the Service
